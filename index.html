		<h1>what is llamechat?</h1>
		<p>llamechat is an irc-like standard to provide federated communication. llamechat in itself, does not exist, it is a specification that servers are built around. it is federated which means every llamechat server can talk to eachother, so if you make an account on foo.com you can join channels on bar.net, and vice-versa.</p>

		<h1>ijson spec</h1>
		<p>json with id, also known as ijson for short, is a way to show ownership and events on top of the ubiquitous json format that was built specifically for llamechat and could be used by alike services. it consists of an <code>@author</code>, <code>@intention</code>, and <code>@object</code>. here is an example ijson event (a request to send a message in this case)</p>
		<pre>{
	"@author": {
		"id": "testuser",     <span class="c">// username of the event's originator</span>
		"host": "example.com" <span class="c">// host/instance of the event's originator</span>
	},
	"@intention": "create",   <span class="c">// main type of event</span>
	"@object": {
		"@type": "message",   <span class="c">// sub-type of event</span>
		<span class="c">// the rest of @object is just info about the event</span>
		"channel": "testchannel",
		"content": "Hello, World! :)
	}
}</pre>
		<p>the <code>@intention</code>, as well as the <code>@object</code>'s <code>@type</code> are not standardized, however, and it is llamechat's (or the ijson-using service's) responsibility to define them, and what non-@ fields <code>@object</code> should contain.</p>
