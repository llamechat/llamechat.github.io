# llamechat-docs
documentation and standard specifications for llamechat.

friendly reminder that this is a project made as a learning experience, it is recommended that you please do not attempt to use this as an actual method of communication for anything other than a proof of concept. please use one of the many already existing communication standards instead, see xmpp, matrix, or even irc. you're completely free to experiment and learn yourself by trying to build a llamechat implementation - but please don't try to actively use it for production purposes.
